#### Visibal Pianl Project 

Language : C 

Overview : As an extension of the waterfall lab course based on openframework, I created the visible piano project using lines that move from frame to frame. For those who have difficulty recognising the notes on the piano, animated bars of appropriate height are generated for each scale to visually infer the pitch of the note. It also provides a record function to save the notes entered.
